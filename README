Compile/run:
     - Compile using
            make MetroSim
     - run executable with
            ./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]
Compile/run Part1:
     - run unit tests with
        unit_test


Program Purpose:
    The purpose of this program is to simulate a metro with
    stations and a train. For part 1 the purpose is to simulate
    the passengers and a queue of these passengers in this metro.

Acknowledgements: 
    Learned about how vectors work through
    lectures about arraylists. Learned about vector operations
    through GeeksforGeeks documentation about vector operations.
    Got help from TA about my implementation when meeting with
    them.


Files: 

Part 2 Files(TO-DO):

main.cpp:
    Main file should be short and handle simple driver
    functions such as reading in files.

    Implementation of MetroSim class. Main
    functionality of running the Metro Simulation, should be able to
    move trains and deal with passengers going on/off the train.

Note:  the program should handle all cases.

Data Structures:

    The PassengerQueue class uses a list ADT to hold a collection
    of passengers. This list ADT supports removal, insertion, and
    access of its elements. This ADT was implemented through the vector
    class, which is an arraylist. I used this because implementation
    because it has O(1) access complexity, and O(1) insertion at the end,
    which is necessary for enqueue passengers.
    Some disadvantages of this data structure is it has an O(n) complexity
    for removal at the start, which is necessary for dequeueing passengers.
    Another disadvantage is that vectors can often allocate more memory than
    necessary because its allocated capacity is greater than its size.

Testing:

    I used unit tests to test the program, testing each function of both 
    classes after I wrote each one. I did not find any bugs while testing. 
    I tested each function using the print or getter functions of Passenger
    or PassengerQueue classes depending on what function I was testing.
    After I wrote each functions of the classes I would creates tests that
    would test multiple functions, like enqueue() then dequque() of the
    PassengerQueue class. For the functions whre it could be applicable, I
    would stress test the functions by using it multiple times.

Note: This assignment comes partially implemented, but student must also
create the driver and add class functionality.

Part that you found most difficult:

    The part I found most difficult was understanding the print functions
    and how the ostream argument worked, including what libraries I need
    to add to unit_tests.h.

Time Spent: 5 hours
