Answer the questions below, and submit your answers under the assignment
"MetroSim Design Checkoff" on Gradescope. You must sign up for a design
checkoff slot with a TA to discuss your provided answers (see spec for link).

Unless otherwise specified, your answers below should be *brief*: no more
than three sentences/question.

        
1. Are you comfortable with reading from stdin (user input) and a text file 
in C++? Are you comfortable reading different types (e.g. ints and strings)?
For this one, don't just answer 'yes' if you are. Write out which data 
types you will need and which functions you will call. 

Answer: 

2. What happens when I move the train (with 'm m') when the train is at the
last provided station? 

Answer: 

3. What classes will you need in your program? What interfaces (i.e. 
functions) do they each provide? 

Answer: 

4. How will you implement add a passenger to a station? How will this 
impact the data structure(s) you use to represent the stations in the 
simulation? 

Answer: 

5. How will you implement moving a train from one station into the next? 
How will you put passengers onto the train? How will you take off the
correct passengers who are leaving at the next station? How will these 
considerations impact the data structure(s) you use to represent the 
train in the simulation? 

Answer: 

6. Does command behavior change based on the source of commands? 
Based on your answer, how could we modularize our command processing
code? Be as detailed as you can.

Answer: 

7. How do you plan to test your program? What evidence of testing do
you plan to submit? 

Answer: 

8. What is your timeline for completing this project? What would you like 
to have completed, and by which dates?
